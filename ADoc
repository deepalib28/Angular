Angular :- Angular is a platform and framework for building client application in HTML and Typescript.	
i> Basic building block of angular is -> NgModule
ii> An app has atleast a root module that enables bootstraping.

Component -> define views which are sets of screen elements that angular can choose among and modify according to program data and logic.
			 Component uses services, which provide specific functionality not directly related to views. Service provider can be injected into component as dependencies, making your code modular, reusable and efficient.
			 Both component and services are simply classes, with decorators that mark their type and provide metadata that tells angular how to use them.

Main:-
i> module
ii> component 
iii> services
iv> decorators
v> directive
vi>Routing 
vii>Dependency injection


Display the list of heroes and display the highlighted hero.
1. for using ngModel directive we need to import formmodules in app.module
2. used ngIf


Myapp2 ->As before, whenever a user clicks on a hero name, the hero detail appears below the hero list. Now the HeroDetailComponent is presenting those details instead of the HeroesComponent.
